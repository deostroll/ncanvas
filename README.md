The collatz tree graphing app

## How this got made

General curiosity. Wanted to explore properties of the collatz conjecture graph. First did this on the browser. But since it had many limitation ended up writing a node project (this).

## What you need to run

A modest PC with node/npm installed.

You would would also need cairo depedencies installed depending on your platform. Please see the readme for the node-canvas github project.

## How to run

```
node collatz.js 5
```
This will generate the tree for 5 iterations. The file will be of the pattern `output-XXX.png`
